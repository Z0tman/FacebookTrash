How to turn the bad into a good game concept ?

Fusing words may be useless at first glance.

But I am a real fan of war strategy games.

Howewer yet, the cadence has become slow over time.

The bad story of Facebook, as an outdated application may lead to an impressive and funny game concept.

The abstraction effort not to specify any army system nor complex architecture through technology is now possible by developping with the new fuseWords Operator.

Off course, the operator is currently at a prototype state, with a lot of missing features.

But let's consider a word generator, and a user with the ability to place words to make them fuse as a main feodal skill.

The imperial has some skills which allows him to spread word here and there.

Your role is to prevent the word invasion from the imperials by choosing between 3 different classes : Lander - Priest - Warlord.

Lander kicks words out, Priest controls the words group, Warlord take words for himself.

To fuse word, if you're a lander, you have to kick the imperial word into the Priest group.
If your a priest, you have to ban imperial key words from your group to allow a proper fusion.
In the end, if you choose the warlord class, the fusion words must entail the imperial words destruction before releasing the hostage word.

My game concept may be fuzzy, but the story of Facebook is very bad in the end.

Why letting them make discrimination ?

Make the bad be a good thing.

Not any of those game may have such cool game concept.

At this stage, that may be hard to imagine the game just with words and a simple fuseWords prototype operator, but a development may be relevant as a proper teamwork with 

great people willing to produce a good game that nobody could make even before that.

Copying the game patterns of the others is what is commonly seen nowadays, and the result is just a waste due to the circonstances.

But, if I share this in this place, this is because I like the mathematics, but I also like the video games.

Then, let's try to give birth to something new that may override that Facebook outdated thing that leads to mistreatment of many people for nothing.
